                Server misconfiguration attacks exploit configuration weaknesses found in web and application servers. Many servers come with unnecessary default and sample files, including applications, configuration files, scripts, and webpages. They may also have unnecessary services enabled, such as content management and remote administration functionality. Debugging functions may be enabled or administrative functions may be accessible to anonymous users. Servers may include well-known default accounts and passwords. Failure to fully lock down or harden the server can leave improperly set file and directory permissions.

                    A phishing website - sometimes called a “spoof” or “lookalike” website - steals your data. Phishing websites look like legitimate websites. But, when visitors are prompted to enter login credentials, personal information, or credit card details, the data is directed to cybercriminals. </p>
                <p class="risk-phishing-content">
                    Looking for an example? Tessian researchers discovered 75 domains spoofing websites related to mail-in voting in August. For more information, read this article: How to Avoid Falling victim to Voting Scams in the 2020 Election. In this case, attackers were after personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card details.

                    Once a phishing website collects your data, it can be used in hacking operations and further phishing attacks, or sold on the dark web.

                    A malware website, on the other hand, installs malicious software on your device. While this could happen after the visitor downloads an application or file, it can also happen without the visitor even noticing.

                <p class="risk-malware-content">
                    Why deploy malware? Malicious software can serve many different purposes, including extracting data from a person's device, taking control of the device, or using the device as an entry point into a network.<br>

                    But phishing and malware sites aren't the only problems.

                <p class="risk-malware-content">
                    Other websites, such as fake news and disinformation websites, might also be considered malicious websites. These sites aim to spread discord, affect election outcomes, and disrupt the activities of human rights groups.
